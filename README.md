# Minecraft Texture Stitcher in Python 3
This program uses json configuration files to put together different textures into one single image. Fully configurable.

# Note
I've stopped working on this project. I may come back to it at some point, but for the time being, I will not be updating it. Feel free to submit pull requests though if you have features you want to add. Also, this was made forever ago on my iPad with the Pythonista app, so it's not very easy to use. It does work though, so if you want to steal the code for your own project, go ahead.

## Setup
To setup this application on your computer, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) module. Once you install Python 3, run `pip install pillow` in command prompt on Windows, or terminal on Linux.
